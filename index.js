/* To create a monthly mortgage rate calculator, we need to know the number of years in months and the monthly interest rate. 

Create a variable called `monthlyInterestRate` and give it the value of interest rate divided by 12. 

Create another variable called `periods` and give it the value of years*12.

Hint: while these calculations can be done in one line, it might be helpful to create a variable called "numerator" to calculate the numerator, and another called "denominator" to calculate the denominator 

Hint #2: you'll need to use the `math` object for parts of this calculation!

When your math is correct, monthlyRate will equal 1073.64
